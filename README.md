# ProfessionalPortfolio

Thank you for your interest. This is where I house all of the projects and small coding exercizes that highlight the different types of codes that I have exposure to. 


Currently you can find the following types:
1. Microsoft Excel - Visual Basic for Applications
2. Python (including Matplotlib, flask, APIs and Pandas)
3. SQL (including SQLAlchemy)
