# ProfessionalPortfolio

Thank you for your interest. This is where I house all of the projects and small coding exercizes that highlight the different types of codes that I have exposure to. 


Currently you can find the following types:
   *Microsoft Excel - Visual Basic for Applications
   *Python (including Matplotlib, flask, APIs and Pandas)
   *SQL (including SQLAlchemy)
